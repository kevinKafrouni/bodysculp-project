		<h1>7 Common Deadlift Mistakes to Avoid</h1>
        <img src="" alt="">
		<p>The deadlift is one of the most effective exercises for building total body strength, but it can also be one of the most challenging. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced lifter, it's important to avoid common mistakes that can lead to injury or limit your progress. Here are seven common deadlift mistakes to avoid:</p>  
        <h2>1. Rounding Your Back</h2>
        <p>Rounding your back is one of the most common mistakes people make when deadlifting. This can lead to serious back injuries, including herniated discs. To avoid this mistake, make sure to keep your back flat and your chest up throughout the entire movement. Engage your core and use your leg muscles to lift the weight, rather than relying on your back.</p>

        <h2>2. Lifting with Your Arms</h2>
        <p>Another common mistake is using your arms to lift the weight instead of your legs and back. Your arms should only be used to hold onto the bar, while your legs and back do the lifting. Make sure to engage your leg muscles and push through your heels to lift the weight.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Using an Improper Grip</h2>
        <p>Using an improper grip can also lead to mistakes and injuries. Make sure to use a grip that feels comfortable and secure for you. A double overhand grip is great for beginners, while more experienced lifters may prefer a mixed grip or hook grip.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Starting with the Wrong Foot Position</h2>
        <p>Starting with the wrong foot position can also affect your form and lead to mistakes. Make sure your feet are hip-width apart and your toes are pointed slightly outwards. The bar should be positioned over the middle of your feet.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Not Engaging Your Core</h2>
        <p>Engaging your core is essential for maintaining proper form and avoiding injury. Make sure to brace your core throughout the entire lift by taking a deep breath and squeezing your abs.</p>
    
        <h2>6. Not Keeping the Bar Close to Your Body</h2>
        <p>Keeping the bar close to your body is important for maintaining proper form and reducing the risk of injury. The bar should be in contact with your shins throughout the entire lift, and should remain close to your body as you lift.</p>
    
        <h2>7. Not Using Proper Breathing Technique</h2>
        <p>Breathing properly is important for maintaining proper form and avoiding injury. Take a deep breath before you lift the weight, and exhale as you reach the top of the lift. Avoid holding your breath or exhaling too early, as this can affect your form and lead to injury.</p>
    
        <p>By avoiding these common mistakes, you can safely and effectively perform the deadlift and achieve your strength training goals. Remember to start with a light weight and gradually increase the weight as you become more comfortable with the movement. Good luck!</p>
