		<p>Eating healthy can often be perceived as expensive, but it doesn't have to be. With some simple tips and planning, it's possible to eat nutritious and delicious meals on a budget. Here are some small and fast tips to help you eat healthy on a budget:</p>

            <li>Plan your meals ahead of time to avoid impulsive purchases and food waste.</li>
            <li>Buy in-season fruits and vegetables, which are often cheaper and fresher.</li>

            <li>Buy in bulk, especially for dry goods like beans, rice, and oats, to save money in the long run.</li>
